My modified Metaculus forecasting bot. Uses only Openrouter and Metaculus API by utilizing many ":online" GPT bots for research, and modified prompting for hopefully better results WITHOUT needing to use other APIs.

main.py forecasts on minibench and the main AI tournaments, while main2.py forecasts on other tournaments. They've got the same bots under the hood, just seperated python files. (main2.py disabled for now because of costs)
